%	强制成一行
	\begin{tabular}{cl}
		Animal & Description \\
		dog    & The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the
		wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
		carnivore. \\
		cat    & The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the
		only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred
		to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the
		family. \\
	\end{tabular}
%	造成这个问题的原因是，l 类型的列即使已经超出了页面的范围，也会将所有的内容排版成一行。为了解决它，你可以采用 p 类型。这种类型将内容排版为指定宽度的段落，垂直顶部居中——这是你大部分情况下所需要的排版方式。将上面的结果与下面的结果比较一下：
	

	\begin{tabular}{cp{9cm}}
		Animal & Description \\
		dog    & The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the
		wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial
		carnivore. \\
		cat    & The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the

	\begin{tabular}{*{3}{c}}

	\begin{tabular}{lll}

		\midrule
		dog    & meat  & medium \\
		horse  & hay   & large  \\
		frog   & flies & small  \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	
%	可用来绘制出仅占用指定列范围、而不占满整行的分割线
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		\toprule
		Animal & Food  & Size   \\
		\midrule
		dog    & meat  & medium \\
		\cmidrule{1-2}
		horse  & hay   & large  \\
		\cmidrule{1-1}
		\cmidrule{3-3}
		frog   & flies & small  \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	
%	还有其他有用的功能。你可以在小括号中指定对应参数以缩短分割线的任意一端。
	\begin{tabular}{lll}

%	LaTeX 不支持纵向单元格的合并。通常通过将单元格留空的方式，来告诉读者单元格是跨行的。
